# Project 3: Traffic Accidents in Toronto
by Mohamed Aamer, Lena Hammoud, Prachi Patel, Shelly Sakkerwal

## Abstract
This research project will conduct a data analysis on traffic accident cases in Toronto resulting in a person Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) from 2017 to 2022. The dataset is taken from Toronto Police Services' Public Safety Data Portal at (https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/TorontoPS::ksi/explore). 

By analyzing the data and presenting compelling visuals, the project seeks to determine if there are any trends in KSI cases in Toronto either through location or over time, including by analyzing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns on KSI cases.

## Tasks
- Data cleaning
- Creating a SQL database schema
- Creating a MongoDB of the data
- Creating a heat map of KSI cases in Toronto using Leaflet
- Creating a dashboard of visuals reflecting KSI cases with user input to filter data by year
